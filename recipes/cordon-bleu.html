    <h3 class="description">Description</h3>
    <p class="description">Lasagne are a type of wide, flat pasta, possibly one of the oldest types of pasta. Lasagne, or the singular 
        lasagna, is also an Italian dish made of stacked layers of this flat pasta alternating with fillings such 
        as ragù and other vegetables, cheese, and seasonings and spices such as garlic, oregano and basil. 
        The dish may be topped with melted grated mozzarella cheese. Typically, the cooked pasta is assembled 
        with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting lasagne casserole is cut into 
        single-serving square portions.</p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. 
                    Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel 
                    seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for 
                    about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 
                    10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with 
                    egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 
                    noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a 
                    third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 
                    1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover 
                    with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not 
                    touch the cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 
                    minutes before serving.</li>
